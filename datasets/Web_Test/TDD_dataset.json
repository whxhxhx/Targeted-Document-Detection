Based on the Book of Revelation , this double album follows an absurd pseudo-narrative about a circus and the apocalypse and yada yada yada . Like all concept albums , it \u2019 s a bunch of nonsense that you don \u2019 t really have to pay attention to , because it \u2019 s the music we \u2019 re here for . And boy , the music on 666 is a trip . Veering between crushing hard rock , piano-led balladry , proggy keyboard indulgence , and whatever the nightmare of \u201c \u221e \u201d can be classified as , 666 is one of the most bonkers records to ever be bankrolled by a major label . Songs drift in and out of being , seemingly at will , with long instrumental passages and ominous chants/narration tying all these disparate pieces together . Oh , and it sounds amazing , too , as the production apparently cost a fortune . By the time the record was released , the band had already broken up\u2014and though it failed to chart or make any money , 666 lives on as an amazing relic of a time when unchecked ambition and unlimited budgets could coexist in the music industry , allowing shit like this to exist . 4 .

Yet the potential was there : Armageddon is a forgotten hard rock gem . Sounding at times like a much heavier version of Yes ( or a less obnoxious Rush ) , Relf and company give their portentous heaviness an oh-so-slight prog-tinge , stretching out muscular riffs and a pummeling rhythm section over intricate arrangements and extended song lengths , all with titles that read like Tolkien chapters . In fact , even though the album is just five tracks spanning over forty minutes ( because the \u2019 70s ) , Armageddon manages to be remarkably taut , interesting , and utterly devoid of aimless noodling\u2026well , until the very end , at least . 3 .

Nowadays , it seems that only boxed sets and reissues include such bonus material . 3-D Covers Another idea for making a standard cover stand out from the pack was to affix 3-D artwork . Lenticular printing is a technique that utilized a thin , finely ridged plastic \u201c lens \u201d layer over a specially printed image . This gives the appearance of depth , and/or the ability for alternating images to appear depending on the viewing angle , all without the need for special glasses .

What causes this , and does it resemble the processes on the seafloor , as many geologists think ? The study suggests that conventional ideas may be wrong .

This idea has been supported by some seismic images of the Afar subsurface . Rifting here is fairly slow\u2014one or two centimeters a year , or 0.4 to 0.8 inches , and this may partly explain why so much solid rock persists . As the lithosphere is pulled apart , it does stretch , crack and thin . However , because the process in this region takes so long , the base of the lithosphere has time to cool down by losing heat to the colder rock above . This keeps the relatively cold , brittle lithosphere thicker than would be expected , and counteracts stretching . Sometimes , though , magma suddenly spurts long distances to the surface , and the earth visibly cracks and pulls apart during spectacular rifting events .

Travelling overland would involve a drive in 4x4 vehicles and then a hike with camels when the terrain becomes too rough to drive , which in all would take four days at least . The only way to get there in time was to fly , and this meant persuading the Ethiopian army to give us a lift . After our overnight flight , and with only a few hours ' sleep between us , we made our way to the University of Addis Ababa where our Ethiopian colleagues had already begun the difficult task of convincing the military to take us to the eruption . After readying our equipment there was nothing more to do but wait and as Wednesday evening came with still no news , we began to wonder if our trip had been in vain . The negotiations were continuing yesterday morning , the Ethiopian scientists shuttling between government departments trying to convince them of the value of our trip . We obsessively checked and re-checked our equipment . There was really nothing else to do . But then late yesterday afternoon the hard work finally paid off .

Eruptions from deep-sea volcanoes were long-thought to be relatively uninteresting compared with those on land . While terrestrial volcanoes often produce spectacular eruptions , dispersing volcanic ash into the environment , it was thought that deep marine eruptions only produced slow moving lava flows . But data gathered by remotely operated vehicles deep in the North East Pacific and analysed by scientists at the University of Leeds , has revealed a link between the way ash is dispersed during submarine eruptions and the creation of large and powerful columns of heated water rising from the ocean floor , known as megaplumes . These megaplumes contain hot chemical-rich water and act in the same way as the atmospheric plumes seen from land-based volcanoes , spreading first upwards and then outwards , carrying volcanic ash with them . The size of megaplumes is immense , with the volumes of water equivalent to forty million Olympic-sized swimming pools .

Abstract David Ferguson \u2019 s mineral prospecting expeditions to South Georgia ( 1912 ) , the Falkland Islands and the South Shetland Islands ( 1913\u20131914 ) , on behalf of the Christian Salvesen whaling company of Leith and now largely forgotten , were early examples of commercially motivated terrestrial exploration in the South Atlantic region . Prior geological knowledge was very limited and Ferguson complemented his unsuccessful prospecting work with attempts to understand the regional geology of the areas that he visited . These interpretations were based on relatively cursory fieldwork undertaken in an arduous environment , and did not prove robust ; but the well-documented specimen collections that Ferguson accumulated provided the basis for excellent and much-cited petrographical accounts by G. W. Tyrrell of Glasgow University . Ferguson had studied geology at the university and the influence of his mentor there , Professor J. W. Gregory , is apparent . In turn , Gregory utilized Ferguson \u2019 s observations in support of a subsided \u2018 South Atlantic continent \u2019 , opposing the \u2018 displacement hypothesis \u2019 for that region formalized by Alfred Wegener from 1912 onwards .

The process , called rifting , mostly takes place on seabeds , but can be seen in a few places on land\u2014nowhere more visibly than in the Afar region of northern Ethiopia . ( See the slideshow below . ) Here , earthquakes and volcanoes have rent the surface over some 30 million years , forming part of Africa \u2019 s Great Rift Valley . What causes this , and does it resemble the processes on the seafloor , as many geologists think ? The study suggests that conventional ideas may be wrong . Past calculations done by scientists predict that the solid rock under the Afar should be stretching and thinning substantially as the continent tears apart ; thus molten rock should not have far to travel to the surface . Led by", "right_context": ", a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University \u2019 s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory , researchers analyzed the chemical makeup of lava chunks they collected from the Afar . They showed that magmas actually came from quite deep\u2013greater than 80 kilometers , or 45 miles , within the earth \u2019 s mantle\u2013and formed under extraordinarily high temperatures , above 1,450 degrees C , or 2,600 F. This implies that magmas are generated by a long-lasting plume of mantle heat . It also indicates that magma must make its way up through a surprisingly thick lid of solid rock , called the lithosphere . This idea has been supported by some seismic images of the Afar subsurface . Rifting here is fairly slow\u2014one or two centimeters a year , or 0.4 to 0.8 inches , and this may partly explain why so much solid rock persists . As the lithosphere is pulled apart , it does stretch , crack and thin . However , because the process in this region takes so long , the base of the lithosphere has time to cool down by losing heat to the colder rock above . This keeps the relatively cold , brittle lithosphere thicker than would be expected , and counteracts stretching . Sometimes , though , magma suddenly spurts long distances to the surface , and the earth visibly cracks and pulls apart during spectacular rifting events . That includes a series of events that started in 2005 , and was closely observed by scientists .

He also studied at the University of Glasgow between 1905 and 1908 and took classes in geology , mineralogy . However , Ferguson did not graduate from either institution and possibly only took the classes to further his work . Prior to his university career he worked as a surveyor and mining engineer , although he is also known as a geologist and Antarctic explorer . Through his work as a mining surveyor and engineer Ferguson kept detailed notes of both his work , such as calculations , maps and field notes , and his travels and some volumes read as travel journals . They detail his visits to Africa , Iran , Newfoundland and locations in Great Britain .

There is a case for that here , because we \u2019 ve seen the size of the physical explosion .

But data gathered by remotely operated vehicles deep in the North East Pacific and analyzed by scientists at the University of Leeds , has revealed a link between the way ash is dispersed during submarine eruptions and the creation of large and powerful columns of heated water rising from the ocean floor , known as megaplumes . These megaplumes contain hot chemical-rich water and act in the same way as the atmospheric plumes seen from land-based volcanoes , spreading first upwards and then outwards , carrying volcanic ash with them . The size of megaplumes is immense , with the volumes of water equivalent to forty million Olympic-sized swimming pools .

This is an area that is both remote and challenging to work in , but also a place that is geologically and culturally fascinating . It is the location , for example , of the oldest Hominid fossils known including Lucy ( Australopithecus afarensis ) . With the sort of serendipity that geological fieldwork sometime relies upon , an opportunity to re-examine how a continent breaks up arose in late 2005 , when a major segment of the plate boundary ruptured . In a series of events which are now very well documented ( see references at the end ) , the Dabbahu-Manda-Hararo rift lurched into life . Over the next six years , the rift has experienced at least 14 further rifting events , three of which were associated with eruptions of basaltic magma . A multi-partner and multi-national research team has been working in the Afar since 2005 , with the aim of using this active rifting episode to understand better how continents rift apart , and how new basaltic crust , which is typical of the ocean floor , begins to form .

David then identified a small number of samples for dating , using the potassium ( K ) -argon ( Ar ) method . This method relies on the fact that all lavas contain small amounts of radioactive ( and naturally occurring ) K-40 , which decays over time Ar-40 . Since argon is a gas , is will naturally escape from lavas as they erupt ; but once a lava is frozen , any Ar that subsequently forms by the decay of potassium will remain trapped within the finely-crystalline structure of the rock . By carefully breaking the rocks apart , pulling out the finely-crystalline fraction of the frozen melt and then heating the samples up in a controlled environment , David Ferguson and Andy Calvert , from the US Geological Survey , were able to extract and measure the tiny amounts of young Argon that had accumulated since eruption .

This idea has been supported by some seismic images of the Afar subsurface . Rifting here is fairly slow\u2014one or two centimeters a year , or 0.4 to 0.8 inches , and this may partly explain why so much solid rock persists . As the lithosphere is pulled apart , it does stretch , crack and thin . However , because the process in this region takes so long , the base of the lithosphere has time to cool down by losing heat to the colder rock above . This keeps the relatively cold , brittle lithosphere thicker than would be expected , and counteracts stretching .

DHMBA has a similar chemical structure to fellow antioxidants \u2014 yet it \u2019 s tested in at 15 times more antioxidant power than synthetic vitamin E. DHMBA may also protect the liver from the oxidative stress that comes with eating a high-PUFA , standard American diet .

The other majors were named after their founders as well . Pickett was named after Don Pickett . Keuffel & Esser was named after their founders . They sold drafting supplies and other tools as well . Some manufacturers just made slide rules , but others made drafting instruments and anything that had scales on it or was used for mechanical drawing . I was a product of the whole generation of engineers who started with drafting boards and slide rules and ending up with electronic calculators and computers . Back to manufacturers , there was also a popular imported slide rule from Japan made by Hemmi , that was a very good slide rule , and was actually the slide rule issued to the Air Force Academy cadets in the \u2018 70s . Lawrence made the low-end slide rules , and they later became Sterling and spun off a few other makers . Acu-Math was another big one .

When I tried to work out exactly why his writing is so different from most of the other stories and poems written for children , I realised that it came down to two main \u2013 and related - things \u2013 the stories are told from the point of view of a child . his books and rhymes don \u2019 t present a sentimental view of childhood.In fact , the humour and storylines are often quite dark and there \u2019 s not always a happy ending.The scenarios are usually weird and/or grotesque and there \u2019 s always at least one adult villain who hates children ! What Influenced Roald Dahl 's Writing ? Many years ago I read Dahl 's autobiography , a fascinating book in two parts called 'Boy'and 'Going Solo ' . In the book , Dahl tells how his mother , Sofie Dahl , would often tell the young Roald and his sisters traditional Norwegian myths and legends from her homeland as they were growing up . The stories often involved trolls , those mythical beings from Norse mythology which were unfriendly and sometimes aggressive towards humans . As he got older , Dahl was an avid reader , especially enjoying fantastic tales of heroism and triumph . He also liked ghost stories , especially a book called \u2018 Trolls \u2019 by", "right_context": ". This interest in antagonistic characters who are out to harm children obviously had an influence on Roald Dahl 's writing : remember poor Matilda 's awful parents ? Dahl \u2019 s poetry is great fun to read aloud , especially to four and five-year-olds who are already familiar with the traditional nursery rhymes and stories . Revolting Rhymes is a great book in which Dahl re-tells some of the most well-known nursery rhymes and fairy tales , replacing the traditional happily-ever-after conclusions with surprise endings . They 're hilarious - well worth getting hold of ! If you 'd like to read a bit more about Roald Dahl and his life , click here .

Little is known of the early life of Robert Reid . Presumably the younger son of nobility , and certainly highly educated , Reid first enters the historical records as Sub-Dean of Elgin Cathedral in the 1520s , suggesting he was probably born some time around 1490 . In 1528 he was appointed Abbot of the Cistercian Kinloss Abbey , and in 1531 he was also appointed Commendator , or patron , of Beauly Priory . Robert Reid had a high regard for learning , and one of his first moves as Abbot at Kinloss was to ask the Italian scholar , Giovanni Ferrerio of Piedmont to come to Kinloss to establish a seat of learning .

The skill comes in the ability to provide enough variety and surface articulation to maintain the visual interest throughout a long facade .

Thus it closely resembled the ancient tower of St Rule incorporated into Bishop Kennedy 's cathedral . However , a stone spire was added in the mid-16th century . One suspects that this addition had more to do with preventing a repetition of the events of 1547 , when the tower was used as a gun emplacement , than out of any aesthetic motivation . The college tower is a severe yet effective piece of architecture . Ornament is used with elegant restraint . At its base , the archway giving entrance to the college court is surmounted by a richly carved panel depicting the arms of Bishop Kennedy supported by two angels and flanked by tall canopied niches . Above this group the tower rises plain and unadorned to the stringcourse upon which the belfry openings rest . There are tall , twin openings on each face of the tower . A clock seems to have been a feature of the tower from the earliest times , and it is likely that it was situated much as it is today , immediately below the belfry . Alterations Although the main architectural features of the church are essentially unaltered , there have been substantial changes made to the details of the building . The 'cloister ' built on to the north wall in the mid-19th century is perhaps the most striking modification . Built in two phases , the first supervised by", "right_context": "and the second by William Nixon , the cloister is a heavy , gloomy construction with neither the grace of the Chapel nor the practicality of its mediaeval predecessor . Indeed , it is interesting to note that a feature of Principal Forbes ' restoration ( c.1861 ) was the use of glazing to enclose the cloister for use as a study room . Almost unnoticeable but of far greater significance than the cloister was the reconstruction undertaken in the 1680s by Provost Skene . The impressive sum of \u00a312,000 was raised by Skene to fund major repairs to the college chapel and tower . Were it not for Skene 's intervention , it is unlikely that the Chapel would have survived to the present day . Apart from the dramatic events involved in the replacement of the old stone-slab roof in 1773 , most of the other changes to the Chapel have been ornamental in nature . The finials that top the buttresses today are Victorian additions ( c.1860 ) , as is the parapet around the base of the spire .

Of these 116,000 were \u2018 half-naked and starving \u2019 . Conditions on the journey were dreadful . Neal quotes a contemporary report : the deck passengers were generally crowded around the funnel of the steamer or huddled together in a most disgraceful manner ; and as they have not been used to sea voyages , they get sick , and perfectly helpless , and covered with the dirt and filth of each other . I have seen the sea washing over the deck of a steamer I came over in , completely drenching the unfortunate people . The immigrants brought typhus fever with them . \u2018 Overwhelming opinion among the English , lay , medical , local and national , was that fever was an Irish import , \u2019 Neal writes . \u2018 Certainly , the evidence is that the majority of victims were Irish. \u2019 In February 1847 the Home Secretary was informed that 88 per cent of the patients in the Liverpool fever hospitals were Irish .

Duncan developed strong views on the Irish , who , he said , were just as \u2018 contented amidst dirt and filth , and close confined air , as in clean and airy situations \u2019 . The Select Vestry in Liverpool was told in March 1847 that amongst a certain number of individuals in a cellar in Bent Street , it was reported that four were lying down in one bed , with fever , that 24 grown-up young men and their sisters were sleeping in a filthy state in the room ; and that 14 persons were sleeping in another filthy place . 36 persons were found huddled together in a room elsewhere and eight had died of fever in one house . Herman Melville visited Liverpool at this time and has a description of the city in his novel Redburn : His First Voyage .

Adding to Kathryn \u2019 s excellent comment below , a couple of legal observations . The court \u2019 s legal premise is pretty novel . Judge Walker rules that laws reflecting the understanding of marriage as the union of a man and a woman violate the Fourteenth Amendment \u2019 s due-process and equal-protection clauses . That is to say , he believes Proposition 8 took away a fundamental right and singled out a protected class for unfair treatment .

This is deeply problematic on at least two levels . Advertisement Advertisement First , none of the testimony in the trial showed ( nor could it have shown ) the voters \u2019 subjective intent in approving the measure . A corollary point is that the question is entirely irrelevant . If voters pulled the lever for that law because they liked the number 8 , or because they have atavistic hatreds , or because they really believe that marriage between husband and wife is a uniquely valuable institution though they have no problem with their gay and lesbian neighbors , it is hard to imagine what those intentions could have to do with whether the law they approve accords with the Constitution . It is worth noting that , since California gives all the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples through another legal status , the idea that most or even many voters were acting out of hatred is pretty unlikely . The second , more fundamental problem stems from the reality that marriage has always been understood , with very few exceptions , as the union of a man and a woman . This is true across time , across cultures , across religious traditions , etc . Does it really seem likely that this remarkable consensus is nothing but a nasty desire of one group to flaunt its privileged position over a"}, {"start_index": 2, "end_index": 3, "url": "https://uk-database.org/2012/08/09/william-duncan-keithmoray/", "label": 0, "left_context": "August 2012", "right_context": "jailed for child rape attempt in Moray A convicted child rapist who admitted a sex attack on another youngster has been jailed .

While not brilliant academically , Barr , who lived in a high rise as a teenager , excelled in sport , particularly the rough and tumble of his new home city \u2019 s passion for rugby league . He loved the game and went on to play for and coach a number of amateur clubs in the city . Aspiring to move into the middle classes , he launched his own business , 1st Step Driving School , which quickly took off . In 2007 , he closed the driving school and sold up to move to Crete with wife of nine years , Julie . Before they emigrated the Barrs lived in a large detached home worth nearly \u00a3300,000 in the village of Rothwell , about six miles from Leeds city centre .

Asit Sen made a successful debut as a filmmaker with the Bengali film Chalachal ( 1956 ) , featuring Arundhati Devi , Asit Baren and Pahari Sanyal .

( Bhatia 97 ) The three earliest films based on COE\u2012 Bhranti Bilas ( 1963 ) , Do Dooni Chaar ( 1968 ) , and Angoor ( 1982 ) exemplify Bhatia \u2019 s point . Keeping the plot fairly like the COE , the filmmakers transmute the setting from Syracuse and Ephesus to Indian small towns . They make alterations to the characters \u2019 attires , behavior , and occupations to ensure that the Indian public can relate to them . In a move remarkably like Vidyasagar \u2019 s \u201c Advertisement \u201d to his prose translation of COE , the filmmakers in each case focus on assuring the audience that the film will definitely make them laugh . The comic expectations are explicitly divulged through posters and opening sequences rather than kept secret . Mishaps arising from tropes \u2014like delayed recognition , mistaken identities , possibilities of swapping sexual partners , and circumlocutory wanderings\u2014 bring back the audience again and again to relish \u201c twinning \u201d or the typical confusions associated with being twins , even as locations , contexts , and characters change . The posters of the movies are most significant in this respect . The poster of Bhranti Bilas showcases the befuddled expressions of the actors Uttam Kumar and Bhanu Bandyopadhyay playing the roles of the pairs of masters and servants respectively insinuating the movie \u2019 s humor drawn from confusion and chaotic misunderstandings . Do Dooni Chaar uses stills of the actors for each master-servant pair , Kishore Kumar and", "right_context": ", along parallel vertical divisions , to accentuate their identicalness and the peculiarity of twinning ( see Figure 1 ) . Angoor \u2019 s poster is the most striking for being emphatic of the trope of twinning . The title obviously relates the alikeness of twins to the alikeness of grapes , providing the audience a clear premise for the plot . The poster also reemphasizes the alikeness through the heads of the lead actors Sanjeev Kumar and Deven Verma literally popping out of grapes . From each grape pops out one pair of look-alikes , indicating not too subtly , that they are monozygotic twins . In a small , easy to miss typeset in the loop of the \u201c g \u201d of Angoor is mentioned \u201c Comedy of Twins. \u201d Gulzar \u2019 s oblique reference to the Shakespearean play \u2019 s title in the poster looks almost slipshod and perfunctory , clearly not intended to attract the bard \u2019 s fans . Figure 1 : First expository scene of Do Dooni Char , bringing all the characters together . Angoor begins with a photo of a distinctly brown-skinned actor dressed as Shakespeare as a moving photo , which later winks at the audience just before the end credits . Of this curious depiction of Shakespeare , Thea Buckley writes that \u201c Gulzar not only elides any mention of the poet \u2019 s nationality but even represents him in live portrait form , posed by an actor of unambiguously native Indian ethnicity \u201d ("}, {"start_index": 84, "end_index": 85, "url": "https://www.getbengal.com/details/asit-sen-the-centurion-nobody-remembered", "label": 0, "left_context": "Asit Sen \u2019 s centenary came and went on September 24 , with hardly a mention in the media .

These films would usually have an introspective scene , with the protagonist sitting in the back seat of a car , in a rickshaw or a bus .

And sure enough , there was . But even Connally could not avoid scandal forever . In the spring of 1971 , while Preston Smith was trying futilely to divorce himself from the imbroglio surrounding Frank Sharp , Connally , now Secretary of the Treasury , advised Richard Nixon to raise federal price supports on milk . Eventually it would be alleged that he took a $ 10,000 bribe from old crony Jake Jacobsen to give that advice , and a jury of his peers , nine of them black , would decide whether John Connally should go to jail . The case turned first on whether Connally would simultaneously be tried for perjury\u2014some embarrassing inconsistencies had crept into his pretrial testimony\u2014but his lawyer was able to prevent it , and then the issue came down to whether John Connally or Jake Jacobsen was telling the truth .

Butler 's mellifluous sound easily bends itself to the groove he 's working : bop , blues , soul-jazz , R & B , pop or boogaloo . At this point in his career , while other guitarists were following Jimi Hendrix 's lead and experimenting with feedback , Butler was perfecting a Hawaiian `` slack-key '' sound . The result is attention to Butler 's gifts as an economical player ; mixing single-line strategies with chordal passages in always-clever turns of phrase . Here , Butler is best when he boogaloos as he does so well on the dance-floor classic `` The Twang Thing '' and the sinewy slide of `` The Soul Roll . '' Tenor man Houston Person is right on cue and erstwhile Ernie Hayes funks wisely on his synth-like organ solos . Other strengths , as was true throughout Butler 's career , are the soul-jazz grooves of `` Work Song , '' `` Bass-ic Blues '' and `` Peacock Alley . '' The remainder of the disc , and the bulk of the entire second set , is unfortunately given over to ballads .

A lot of Big Lazy \u2019 s music has been licensed for film and TV , which led me to start scoring films . Our first album , Amnesia , was used for the NBC series \u201c Homicide : Life on the Streets. \u201d I scored the first two seasons of HBO \u2019 s \u201c Bored To Death , \u201d and most recently scored Art and Craft , a film about an art forger ; I wrote a lot of pieces inspired by [ early jazz guitarist ] Eddie Lang . Films that come to mind that relate to your music are Orson Welles \u2019 Touch of Evil and Sergio Leone \u2019 s westerns . Touch of Evil is one of my all time favorites , thanks to Henry Mancini \u2019 s score and Barney Kessel \u2019 s raunchy guitar work . I \u2019 m a devotee of Ennio Morriconne \u2019 s scores for the Leone \u2019 s western films , and Nino Rota , who scored Fellini \u2019 s films like La Dolce Vita and The Godfather . Who were your key guitar influences ? Early on , I studied with [ noted jazz player ] Sal Salvador , so I learned about Wes Montgomery and Charlie Christian . Sal stressed the lyrical side of a melody \u2013 telling a story with guitar . Later , I started investigating players like Scotty Moore , Cliff Gallup , and Paul Burlison . For blues , I liked Freddie King , Albert Collins ,", "right_context": ", and Johnny Guitar Watson , while instrumental favorites included Link Wray , the Shadows , and the Ventures . Also , country pickers like Hank Garland , Jimmy Bryant , and Merle Travis . Another slide influence was Don Helms , who played with Hank Williams and Patsy Cline in the \u2019 40s and \u2019 50s . All this led to the downtown New York City music scene , where players blurred between rock and jazz ; I \u2019 m thinking here of avant-garde slide master David Tronzo , Bill Frisell , and Marc Ribot .

As a guitarist , A & R man , engineer , producer , songwriting partner of Otis Redding , Eddie Floyd and a dozen others and founding member of both Booker T. and the MG \u2019 s and The Mar-Keys , Cropper was literally involved in virtually every record issued by Stax from the fall of 1961 through year end 1970.Such credits assure Cropper of an honored place in the soul music hall of fame . As co-writer of ( Sittin \u2019 On ) The Dock Of The Bay , Knock On Wood and In The Midnight Hour , Cropper is in line for immortality . Born on October 21 , 1941 on a farm near Dora , Missouri , Steve Cropper moved with his family to Memphis at the age of nine . In Missouri he had been exposed to a wealth of country music and little else . In his adopted home , his thirsty ears amply drank of the fountain of Gospel , R & B and nascent Rock and Roll that thundered over the airwaves of both black and white Memphis radio .

Released on Satellite Records , the record shot into the Top 5 on both the pop and R & B charts , When a California company also called Satellite Records threatened to sue over use of the name , the Memphis-based Satellite metamorphosized into Stax . By the time of the Mar-Keys record , Cropper was something of a studio veteran , already having played sessions for Sun , Duke-Peacock and Hi Records . It was only natural , then . that shortly after quitting the Mar-Keys during their first tour , Cropper was given the keys to the Stax studio and became , along with company co-owner Jim Stewart , the label \u2019 s de facto A & R man and engineer .

Mayfield is probably best known for his anthemic music with The Impressions and for the soundtrack to the blaxploitation film Superfly . Perhaps because he did n't cross over to the pop audience as heavily as Motown 's stars , it may be that the scope of Curtis Mayfield 's talents and contributions have yet to be fully recognized . Judged merely by his records alone , the man 's legacy is enormous . As the leader of the Impressions , he recorded some of the finest soul vocal group music of the 1960s . As a solo artist in the 1970s , he helped pioneer funk and helped introduce hard-hitting urban commentary into soul music . `` Gypsy Woman , '' `` It 's All Right , '' `` People Get Ready , '' `` Freddie 's Dead , '' and `` Superfly '' are merely the most famous of his many hit records . But Curtis Mayfield was n't just a singer . Born in in Chicago , IL , he wrote most of his material at a time when that was not the norm for soul performers . He was among the first -- if not the very first -- to speak openly about African-American pride and community struggle in his compositions . As a songwriter and a producer , he was a key architect of chicago soul , penning material and working on sessions by notable Windy City soulsters like Gene Chandler , Jerry Butler , Major Lance , and", "right_context": ". In this sense , he can be compared to Smokey Robinson , who also managed to find time to write and produce many classics for other soul stars . Mayfield was also an excellent guitarist , and his rolling , Latin-influenced lines were highlights of the Impressions ' recordings in the '60s . During the next decade , he would toughen up his guitar work and production , incorporating some of the best features of psychedelic rock and funk . Mayfield began his career as an associate of Jerry Butler , with whom he formed the Impressions in the late '50s . After the Impressions had a big hit in 1958 with `` For Your Precious Love , '' Butler , who had sung lead on the record , split to start a solo career . Mayfield , while keeping the Impressions together , continued to write for and tour with Butler before the Impressions got their first Top 20 hit in 1961 , `` Gypsy Woman . '' Mayfield was heavily steeped in gospel music before he entered the pop arena , and gospel , as well as doo wop , influences would figure prominently in most of his '60s work . Mayfield was n't a staunch traditionalist , however . He and the Impressions may have often worked the call-and-response gospel style , but his songs ( romantic and otherwise ) were often veiled or unveiled messages of black pride , reflecting the increased confidence and self-determination of the African-American community ."}]}, "David Lane (director)": {"David Lane": [{"start_index": 0, "end_index": 1, "url": "http://www.thomasandadamson.com/about-thomas-adamson/meet-the-team/david-lane/", "label": 0, "left_context": "", "right_context": "has extensive experience in quantity surveying and project management in both private and public sectors .

And we \u2019 ve made important headway toward immunological interventions that have reversed advanced melanomas , for example . But we need to continue our research efforts to expand the population that can benefit from these treatments and extend their efficacy . The second frontier is detection and prevention of cancer . Our current cancer treatments focus on treating cancer once it has developed and , more often than not , once it has metastasized to other sites in the body . Ideally you want to catch cancer early on or to prevent it entirely . Today we are seeing tremendous advances in both detection and prevention . In terms of prevention , we already have one intervention , the HPV vaccine , which can vaccinate girls and boys against contracting HPV , the virus that can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women and oral , penile and anal cancers in men . Research by Ludwig scientists in Brazil showed that the virus exhibits long-term infection in men , findings that helped secure the recommendation that boys receive the HPV vaccine as well . We are also seeing tremendous advances in detection . New blood tests allow us to look at DNA in the blood and determine whether and what type of tumor is present , for example .

Republic pictures recognized the character 's appeal and in 1937 brought the trench coat-wearing detective to the big screen in his first serial , simply named Dick Tracy . This was a typical serial and not really an adaptation of the comic strip . Tracy battled a masked villain with super-scientific devices ( including a flying wing and a sonic device that could destroy nearly anything ) and his own brother who turned evil after a brain operation . The following year the second Tracy serial was released , Dick Tracy Returns . This was a vast improvement over the first entry and much closer to the comic strip . Though Tracy plays a federal agent rather than a common police detective in this adventure , he 's facing a family of ordinary villains armed with guns rather than sonic cannons .
